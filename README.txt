The way you use the website is you put the name of the game you want to put in you then select what genre the game is. After submitting the information you can select either all of the games or just games under the same genre by selecting inside of the drop down box and clicking find info. You’ll be able to update by clicking on the find update button and changing the game name and genre. You’ll be able to delete by clicking the delete button and selecting which ones you want to delete.
